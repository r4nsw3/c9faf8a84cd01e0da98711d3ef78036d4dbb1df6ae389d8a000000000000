  |   The side-scrolling/top-down hybrid action adventure gameplay          |
  |   returns with a brand new sequel to "Blaster Master Zero"!             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Experience the yet-untold story of Jason and Eve after defeating      |
  |   Earth's mutant scourge as they venture into the depths of space in    |
  |   their new battle tank, "GAIA-SOPHIA"!                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The story of Blaster Master Zero 2 begins a few months after the      |
  |   events of the first game (released on March 9, 2017), where the       |
  |   main protagonist Jason saves planet Earth from the mutants. Eve has   |
  |   been infected by mutant cells that are slowly corrupting her body,    |
  |   so together with Jason and Fred, they board G-SOPHIA and begin an     |
  |   intergalactic journey to Eve's home planet, Sophia, in hopes of       |
  |   finding a cure for the mutant infection.                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A perfect blend of action-adventure through outer space and the       |
  |   signature Blaster Master gameplay creates a formula for a fun new     |
  |   experience.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Gaea System converts the energy created by the impact of          |
  |   falling from tall heights or taking damage, then turns that energy    |
  |   into SP. By making good use of the terrain, more and more SP can be   |
  |   recovered, allowing Jason to use more of G-SOPHIA's sub-weapons.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Mastering the Gaia System brings out G-SOPHIA's full potential,       |
  |   allowing players to traverse stages in an ultra-satisfying way.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Jason's got a new trick up his sleeve! In top-down view stages,       |
  |   Jason can initiate a BLAST COUNTER at the moment an enemy makes an    |
  |   attack, allowing him to deliver a powerful counterattack.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Getting a feel for BLAST COUNTERS allows you to dish out lots of      |
  |   damage and make good use of your wide variety of gun levels and       |
  |   sub-weapons. This is the key to clearing top-down view stages with    |
  |   speed!                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Search high and low across the planets you visit to find hidden       |
  |   maps for small planetoids in their orbit. Explore a wide variety of   |
  |   planetoids and find upgrades for G-SOPHIA and Jason.                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Throughout his journey, Jason crosses paths with a motley cast of     |
  |   Metal Attacker battle-tank pilots and their respective support        |
  |   droids. Sometimes they're friend, sometimes they're foe.              |
  |                                                                         |
